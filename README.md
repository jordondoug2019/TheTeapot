Often times,black women are often presented with images and messages on the internet and mass media that are not reaffirming to the beauty they withhold. Whether it's their physical beauty or the beauty of their spirit, black women are often looked over and voices slienced.
The Teapot is an application that sends inspirational, spiritual, and motivational messages to black women while browsing the web. 

Full Stack Django project using REST Framework, Django web push package, and Django Templating.
